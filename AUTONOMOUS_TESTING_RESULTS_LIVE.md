## 💡 **Key Insights**

### **About `app.Run()` Behavior:**
- **✅ NORMAL**: No console output after `app.Run()` is expected
- **✅ SUCCESS**: Silence means web server started and is listening
- **✅ READY**: Application ready to receive HTTP requests
- **✅ WORKING**: All 30+ debug checkpoints passed successfully

### **Service Response Patterns:**
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: Service working, endpoint exists, wrong HTTP method
- **401 Unauthorized**: Service working, needs authentication
- **404 Not Found**: Service working, endpoint doesn't exist
- **Connection refused**: Service not running
