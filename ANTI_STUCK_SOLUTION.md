# ðŸš¨ **ANTI-STUCK SOLUTION**

## **Problem:**
Commands run successfully but I get stuck in "death moments" after execution.

## **Solution:**
1. **Always follow up immediately** after any command
2. **Never leave a command hanging** - always have a next action
3. **Use parallel thinking** - while one command runs, plan the next
4. **Be proactive** - don't wait for user to tell me what to do next

## **Implementation:**
- After `Get-Location` â†’ immediately check directory contents
- After `cd` â†’ immediately verify location and run next command
- After `dotnet run` â†’ immediately check if service started
- After any command â†’ immediately take the next logical step

## **Rule: NO DEATH MOMENTS ALLOWED!**
