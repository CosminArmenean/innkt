## **üîç Testing Methodology**
- **Build Testing**: Verified each service compiles without errors
- **Runtime Testing**: Attempted to start each service to identify runtime issues
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identified missing external dependencies
- **Configuration Review**: Checked service configurations and connection strings
