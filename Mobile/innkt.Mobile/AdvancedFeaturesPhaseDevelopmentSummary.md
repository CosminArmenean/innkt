## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Architecture
```typescript
// Robust WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection
private setupWebSocketEventHandlers(): void {
  this.ws.onopen = () => {
    this.startHeartbeat();
    this.emit('connectionStatusChanged', true);
  };
  
  this.ws.onclose = (event) => {
    if (event.code !== 1000) {
      this.scheduleReconnect();
    }
  };
}
```

### Offline Action Queue
```typescript
// Priority-based action processing
private sortActionsByPriority(actions: OfflineAction[]): OfflineAction[] {
  const priorityOrder = { high: 0, normal: 1, low: 2 };
  
  return actions.sort((a, b) => {
    const priorityDiff = priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority];
    if (priorityDiff !== 0) return priorityDiff;
    return a.timestamp - b.timestamp;
  });
}
```

### Media Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// Comprehensive media processing with multiple stages
async processImage(uri: string, options: MediaProcessingOptions): Promise<MediaFile> {
  let processedUri = uri;
  
  if (options.filters) {
    processedUri = await this.applyFilters(processedUri, options.filters);
  }
  
  if (options.watermark) {
    processedUri = await this.addWatermark(processedUri, options.watermark);
  }
  
  // Final processing with expo-image-manipulator
  const result = await manipulateAsync(processedUri, [...], {...});
  return this.createProcessedMediaFile(result, options);
