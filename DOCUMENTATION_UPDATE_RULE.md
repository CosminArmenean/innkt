## Rule
When significant work is completed or a milestone is achieved, the AI assistant should:

1. **Ask the user**: "Would you like me to update the project documentation files?"
2. **Wait for confirmation**: User responds "yes" or "no"
3. **If yes**: Update the following documentation files based on the work completed

### 3. **FINAL_PLATFORM_READINESS_REPORT.md**
